Optimized status quo cybersecurity in quantum systems. Revamped quantum computing security software in Python for improving encryption key algorithm strength by ~60%. Improved the popular BB84 algorithm for quantum key distribution (QKD), implementing a layer for correlating certain qubit states to increase key length and strength and also a quantum signature for authenticity verification using the "swap test".
